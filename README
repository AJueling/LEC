Project Lorenz Energy Cycle (LEC)
by Andr\'e J\"uling, July 2018

Calculates and analyses Lorenz Energy Cycle (LEC) of Parallel Ocean Program 
(POP) model run that showed OHC oscillations in the Southern Ocean 
(Le Bars, GRL 2016).

In addition to the LEC other quantities are analysed, such as 
  (a) the barotropic and overturning stream functions,
  (b) the mixed layer depths,
  (c) ocean heat content / temperature anaomalies.


================================================================================
Workflow for the LEC calculation
================================================================================

  (1) set up POP to write out required fields
      ajusted output fields in [advection_BY_JAN.f90]

  (2) calculate geometry files

  (3) run POP

  (4) calculate desired temporal averages (in our case: 5 years) as well as a 
      full run average (in our case: 51 years = one SOM cycle) [TAVG.f90]

  (5) analyse output:
      (a) [LEC.f90]
          to calculate all LEC terms plus kinetic energy advection;
          output is stored as 3D binary files and global integrals as text files
      (b) [analyze_LEC.f90]
          perform regional/phase integrals;
          output is stored as text files
      (c) [OSF_BSF.f90]
          calculates overturning and barotropic streamfunctions
      (d) [MXL.f90]
          calculates max MLD
      (e) [OHC.f90]
          calculates TMP anomaly

  (6) plotting
      (a) [LEC-paper-timeseries.py]
          time series
          Figure 1    : overturning/barotropic streamfunction, SOM index, max MLD
          Figure 10   : LEC components  
      (b) [LEC-paper-boxplots.py]
          Figure 3    : energy flow box plots
      (c) [LEC-paper-maps.py]
          Figure 2    : map of max MLD, depth-time temperature anomaly
          Figures 4-9 : polar maps of LEC components
